# Safety Bank USA - Fake Bank Exercise

## What is this?

This is a **fake bank website** made for an ethics class. It’s just for fun and **has no real functionality**. The purpose of the project is to discuss some ethical issues around web development and online security.

## What's on the site?

- **Fake Bank Login**: There’s a form where you can enter a checking account number and a PIN, but it **doesn’t actually do anything**.
- **Urgent Alerts**: An alert pops up after 2 seconds, pretending to be urgent, with a timer counting down, but it’s all just for show.
- **Thank You Message**: After submitting the form, a "thank you" message with a checkmark appears saying the issue has been fixed—but again, **nothing really happens**.

## Why was this made?

This site is just a mock-up I created for fun to talk about ethical and security-related topics in web design. **It’s not real** and isn’t connected to any banking systems. Don’t worry, **it’s all pretend**.

## Important:

- **This website doesn't do anything for real**.
- Don’t enter real personal info—this is a fake site made for an assignment.
- Everything on here (emails, phone numbers, etc.) is made up.
